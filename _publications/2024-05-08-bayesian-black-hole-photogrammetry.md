## Question
What measurements be made from the black hole images of the EHT?

## Description
Photogrammetry is a technique to that measures the 3d structure of objects from interpretation of its images. 
This technique normally multiple images of an object to construct 3D geometries. 
Black hole images are, however made of the sum of multiple sub-images of a source, thus allowing for the possibility of photogrammetry being performed on a single image.
If such photogrammetry from a single image is successful, it could potentially be applied to real data to make measurements on things like black hole mass, spin, inclination, fluid velocity and magnetic field orientation.

We show that it is possible to perform photogrammetry on black hole images by constructing a dual-cone emission model for Low Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGN). 
We show that our model is an accurate and faithful representation of time-averaged GRMHD.
We then fit our model to the 2017 EHT data of M87<sup>*</sup>, and produce measurement results that are consistent with the previous stellar dynamics measurements and large scale jet inclination measurements.
