## Question
What are the image signatures of the jet in the near horizon region around a black hole?

## Description
We develop a "dual-cone" model for millimeter wavelength emission near a spinning black hole. The model consists of optically thin, luminous cones of emission, centered on the spin axis, which are meant to represent jet walls. The resulting image is dominated by a thin ring. We first consider the effect of the black hole's spin on the image and show that the dominant effect is to displace the ring perpendicular to the projection of the spin axis on the sky by {::nomarkdown}  $2a_*\sin i+\mathcal{O}(a_*^3)${:/}. This effect is lower order in {::nomarkdown}$a_*${:/} than changes in the shape and size of the photon ring itself but is undetectable without a positional reference. We then show that the centerline of the jet can provide a suitable reference: its location is exactly independent of spin if the observer is outside the cone and nearly independent of spin if the observer is inside the cone. If astrophysical uncertainties can be controlled, then spin displacement is large enough to be detectable by future space very long baseline interferometry missions. Finally, we consider ring substructure in the dual-cone model and show that features in total intensity are not universal and depend on the cone-opening angle.
We investigate general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations to determine the physical origin of the twisty patterns of linear polarization seen in spatially resolved black hole images and explain their morphological dependence on black hole spin. By characterizing the observed emission with a simple analytic ring model, we find that the twisty morphology is determined by the magnetic field structure in the emitting region. Moreover, the dependence of this twisty pattern on spin can be attributed to changes in the magnetic field geometry that occur due to the frame dragging. By studying an analytic ring model, we find that the roles of Doppler boosting and lensing are subdominant. Faraday rotation may cause a systematic shift in the linear polarization pattern, but we find that its impact is subdominant for models with strong magnetic fields and modest ion-to-electron temperature ratios. Models with weaker magnetic fields are much more strongly affected by Faraday rotation and have more complicated emission geometries than can be captured by a ring model. However, these models are currently disfavoured by the recent EHT observations of M87*. Our results suggest that linear polarization maps can provide a probe of the underlying magnetic field structure around a black hole, which may then be usable to indirectly infer black hole spins. The generality of these results should be tested with alternative codes, initial conditions, and plasma physics prescriptions.
