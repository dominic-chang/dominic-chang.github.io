## Question
How can measurements of the photon ring be used to discern between space times.

## Summary
We explore the universal symmetries of the black hole photon ring in a wide range of non-Kerr spacetimes,
including the Kerr-Newman, Kerr-Sen, Kerr-Bardeen, and Kerr-Hayward metrics. The demagnification exponent
(𝛾) controls the size and flux scaling of higher-order images, which appear in the photon ring, the time delay
(𝜏) determines the timing of their appearance, and the rotation parameter (𝛿) relates their relative orientations
on the image plane. Our investigation reveals that these critical parameters respond distinctly to variations in
black hole spin, generalized charge, and observer inclination, establishing them as complementary probes of
spacetime geometry: 𝛾 is predominantly influenced by charge and spin, 𝜏 is strongly affected by inclination,
especially for near-extremal black holes, and 𝛿 is highly sensitive to spin. Notably, we find that the time delay
provides an independent constraint on shadow size for polar observers, while the rotation parameter facilitates
metric-independent spin measurements. Specifically, for Kerr black holes, the total variation in 𝛾, 𝜏, and 𝛿 across
all possible inclinations and spins is ≲ 20%, ≲ 10%, and ≲ 60%, respectively. By contrast, the Kerr shadow
radius varies by only ≲ 8%. A future joint measurement of these critical parameters—along with the black hole
shadow size—will enable precise spacetime characterization, including measurements of the spin, inclination,
and generalized charge.
