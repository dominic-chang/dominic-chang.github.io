## Need
Modular, portable, gpu accelerated ray-tracing to make future analyses possible.


## Summary
Krang is a Julia package that implements efficient algorithms for raytracing emission geometries in the Kerr black hole space time. 
It is GPU compatible and is specialized for studies of sub-image contributions from gravitationally lensed sources. 
Such algorithms are of interest for modeling the sources seen by Very Long
Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations of Low Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGN) such as those imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC).
