## Question
Can you directly infer physical parameters from EHT data? 

## Description
We try to answer this question with the Kerr Bayesian Analytic Modelling (KerrBAM) code. 
This code is useful since it produces General Relativistic Hydrodynamics (GRMHD) like images at many orders of magnitude faster speeds. 
We use this model to produce Bayesian posteriors that quantify the probability of the blackhole and the fluid having certain physical parameters.
