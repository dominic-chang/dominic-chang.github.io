How much physics is needed to create the polarized image of M87? We attempt to answer that question with a simple blackhole toy model that reproduces the 2017 Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) image of M87<sup>*</sup>. The model is of a ring of plasma that surrounds a blackhole and emits polarized light. This emisison is lensed by the underlying spacetime, and imaged by a far away observer with the resolution of the EHT. This simple model is largely capable of reproducing the image morphology of M87<sup>*</sup>, and can be used to answer questions about bulk physics properties like the direction of the magnetic field, and predict polarization properties of flares around SgrA<sup>*</sup>, the supermassive blackhole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy.
