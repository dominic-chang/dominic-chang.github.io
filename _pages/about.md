# Who am I?

I am currently a PhD candidate in physics at Harvard University working under [Michael Johnson](https://www.scintillatingastronomy.com/) with the local [Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/) group. 
I my current research is on black hole phenomenology with a focus on radio astronomy. 
Some topics and techniques I routinely use include strong field [gravitational lensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens), The phenomenology of [exotic black hole space times](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1972ApJ...178..347B/abstract), [Newman-Penrose Formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newman%E2%80%93Penrose_formalism) and [Bayesian inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference). 

I studied black hole thermodynamics and quantum field theories in curved space times in undergrad. 
I did my undergrad thesis on a project where I used dimensional reduction techniques to caclulate thermodynamic quantities for near extramal [Kerr black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr_metric).

I'm a polyglot programmer and have done projects in C/C++, openGL, webGL, javascript, matlab, labview, typescript, Java, python and most recently julia . I like to learn about random things and am attracted to engaging conversations. In my spare time, I sometimes work on coding projects and make bad music demos.
