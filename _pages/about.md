# Astrophysicist

I am currently a PhD candidate in physics at Harvard University working under [Michael Johnson](https://www.scintillatingastronomy.com/) with the local [Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/) group. 
I my current research is on black hole phenomenology with a focus on radio astronomy. 
Some topics and techniques I routinely use include strong field [gravitational lensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens), the phenomenology of [exotic black hole space times](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1972ApJ...178..347B/abstract), [Newman-Penrose Formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newman%E2%80%93Penrose_formalism) and [Bayesian inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference). 

I studied black hole thermodynamics through their effects on quantum field theory in undergrad. 
I did my undergrad thesis on a project where I used dimensional reduction techniques to caclulate thermodynamic quantities of near extramal [Kerr black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr_metric).
I then briefly worked on collider physics where I automated some of the pipeline used for metrology on the detectors that were to be installed in the [ATLAS](https://atlas.cern/) experiment during [CERN's long shutdown 3](https://lhc-commissioning.web.cern.ch/schedule/LHC-long-term.htm).

I'm a polyglot programmer and have done projects in C/C++, openGL, webGL, javascript, matlab, labview, typescript, Java, python and most recently julia. 
I like to learn about random things and am attracted to engaging conversations. In my spare time, I sometimes work on coding projects and make bad music demos. You can checkout some of my interactive physics projects in [*Projects*]({% link _pages/projects.md%}).
