This was my a presentation of a series of Blackhole Thermodynamics calculations I did for my undergraduate thesis which heavily utilize a dimensional reduction technique. The calculation was not really holography, but feels similar to holography in the sense that the dimensional reduction converts some gravitating degrees of freedom to gauge degrees of freedom. The gauge degrees of freedom acutally end up not contributing to the Hawking radiation that an observer sees when near the horizon in the lower dimensional theory, atleast not for the metrics that were studied.
