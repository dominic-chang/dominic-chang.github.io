The Gravitational physics working group has been recenlty pushing for the evelopment of simple models that can be used to describe EHT observations.
This talk details how simple and efficient models can be quickly assembled from the existing tools in a module that I've beend developing. 
Here's an example of 2 models that show how aparent dynamics can change due to time delay of light traveling from a hotspot to an observer.
